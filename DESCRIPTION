Version: 0.2.1
Author: Michael Gordy and Alexander McNeil
Maintainer: Michael Gordy <michael.gordy@frb.gov>
Description: This package implements the class of moment-based spectral backtests described
   in Gordy and McNeil (2018).  Unconditional and conditional tests of coverage are both
   provided.  The package is designed for extensibility to the user's choice of kernel
   function and (in the conditional tests) transformation of lagged PIT values.
